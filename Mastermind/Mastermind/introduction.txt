Welcome to Master Mind, a two player deduction game
in which the aim is to break the hidden code in the
fewest number of moves possible!

You will be the Code Breaker. Your job is to try and
crack the secret code made by the computer, the Code
Maker!

Here are the rules you need to follow to play and win
as the Code Breaker...

Rules:
	- The Code Maker will select a combination
	  of 4 coloured pegs to create the hidden code.

	- You will attempt to crack the hidden code
	  by providing a combination of these coloured
	  pegs in the order you think they were placed
	  by the Code Maker.

	- If your guess is wrong, the Code Maker will
	  give you a clue to help you in your next turn.
	  A black peg (?) will be shown to indicate a 
	  correct colour in the wrong position. A white
	  peg (o) will be shown to indicate a correct 
	  colour in the correct position.

	- You must guess the code in 10/12/14 turns or
 	  less (depending on your skill level), otherwise
 	  the game is over!

Good luck, and have fun playing Master Mind!
